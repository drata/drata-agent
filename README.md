# Drata Agent

The Drata Agent is a lightweight application that lives in your computer's toolbar. This application is granted READ ONLY access to your system preferences to help ensure proper security configurations are set - such as screensaver locking, password manager, antivirus software and automatic updates are enabled. These security configurations are required for SOC 2 compliance.
